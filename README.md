# XAI-Enhanced-Edge-CIoT-IIoT-Security
XAI-Enhanced Adversarial Resilient Deep Learning Framework for CIoT/IIoT Security  This repository contains the implementation of our novel adversarial-resilient and interpretable Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Consumer and Industrial IoT environments.
##Framework Overview
The framework integrates five key components:
1. **CGAN-based Class Balancing** - Handles severe class imbalance
2. **LSTM Denoising Autoencoder** - Dimensionality reduction and noise robustness
3. **MHSA-BiGRU Classifier** - Temporal pattern learning with attention
4. **Ensemble Adversarial Training** - Robustness against white/black-box attacks
5. **SHAP Explanations** - Model interpretability and transparency
## Key Features
- ✅ Adversarial resilience (Auto-PGD, Square Attack, CW, DeepFool)
- ✅ Real-time edge deployment (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi compatible)
- ✅ SHAP-based interpretability (local and global explanations)
- ✅ Protocol-aware design for IoT/IIoT traffic
- ✅ Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, NISTIR 8259
  ## Datasets Supported
- Edge-IIoTset
- CIC-IoT2023
